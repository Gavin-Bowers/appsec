# How to use flask_test

This program is a simple Flask server with a text input feature. 

You can run it with `python3 flask_test.py` and it'll run a server locally which you can access at the address `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

If you enter text in the box and click submit, it will take you to a page which reads back the text you entered.
